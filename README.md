To create the javascirpt file I started by defining my variables.
Then:
-I established the password length and a true - false value for the password variables
-Checked the user input values by console logging them out in the browser
-Checked if the variables should be included or not
-Combined character list
-Generated the password using a for loop and Math.floor and Math.random
-Added the password value to the text area 
-And finally copying the password to the clipboard
